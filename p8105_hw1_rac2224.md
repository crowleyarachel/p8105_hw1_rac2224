\#\#Problem 1

\#\#creating dataframe

``` {r}
library(tidyverse)

hw1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  norm_samp_log = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("one","two","three","four","five","six", "seven","eight"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("cat", "dog", "bird", "cat","dog","bird", "cat", "dog"))
)
```

\#\#Taking the mean of each variable

``` {r}
mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp))
```

\#\#A mean was calculated for norm\_samp

``` {r}
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
```

\#\#The following error message was recieved when the mean of character
vector, vec\_char, was requested: “argument is not numeric or logical:
returning NA\[1\] NA”. This occured because it is composed of character
variables and you cannot derive a mean.

``` {r}
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
```

\#\#The following error message was recieved when the mean of factor
vector, vec\_factor, was requested: “argument is not numeric or logical:
returning NA\[1\] NA”. This occured because it is composed of factor
variables and you cannot derive a mean.

``` {r}
mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp_log))
```

\#\#A mean was calculated for the logical
vector

``` {r}
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
```

## Following message was recieved: NAs introduced by coercion\[1\] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` {r}
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
```

\#\#output: \[1\] 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

``` {r}
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp_log))
```

\#\#output: \[1\] 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1

``` {r}
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,norm_samp))
```

\#\#vec\_factor, norm\_samp\_log, and norm\_samp could all be converted
to a numeric variable. vec\_char, the character vector, could not be
converted to numeric, which explains why a mean was not calculated.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

`{r cars} summary(cars)`

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

`{r pressure, echo=FALSE} plot(pressure)`

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
