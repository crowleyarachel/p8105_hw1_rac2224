``` r
hw1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  norm_samp_log = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("one","two","three","four","five","six", "seven","eight"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("cat", "dog", "bird", "cat","dog","bird", "cat", "dog"))
)
```

\#\#Taking the mean of each variable

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.3347501

\#\#A mean was calculated for
    norm\_samp

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

\#\#The following error message was recieved when the mean of character
vector, vec\_char, was requested: “argument is not numeric or logical:
returning NA\[1\] NA”. This occured because it is composed of character
variables and you cannot derive a
    mean.

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

\#\#The following error message was recieved when the mean of factor
vector, vec\_factor, was requested: “argument is not numeric or logical:
returning NA\[1\] NA”. This occured because it is composed of factor
variables and you cannot derive a mean.

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp_log))
```

    ## [1] 0.625

\#\#A mean was calculated for the logical
vector

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

## Following message was recieved: NAs introduced by coercion\[1\] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
```

    ## [1] 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

\#\#output: \[1\] 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp_log))
```

    ## [1] 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1

\#\#output: \[1\] 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
    1

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.5666047  1.0080352 -0.5373036  0.4452277 -0.7794847  1.1350430
    ## [7]  0.5952095  1.3778781

\#\#vec\_factor, norm\_samp\_log, and norm\_samp could all be converted
to a numeric variable. vec\_char, the character vector, could not be
converted to numeric, which explains why a mean was not calculated.

\#\#converting the logical
    vector

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,norm_samp_log)) * (pull(hw1_df,norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.0000000 1.0080352 0.0000000 0.4452277 0.0000000 1.1350430 0.5952095
    ## [8] 1.3778781

``` r
as.factor(pull(hw1_df,norm_samp_log)) * (pull(hw1_df,norm_samp))
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp_log)),
    ## (pull(hw1_df, : '*' not meaningful for factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(hw1_df,norm_samp_log)))*(pull(hw1_df,norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.5666047  2.0160704 -0.5373036  0.8904554 -0.7794847  2.2700861

\#\#Problem 2

``` r
set.seed(1234)

plot_df2 = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  vec_log2 = x + y >1,
  vec_numeric2 = as.numeric(vec_log2), 
  vec_factor2 = as.factor(vec_log2)
)
```

  - The size of the dataset is 500 rows and 5 columns
  - The mean is 0.0018388, the median is -0.0207073, and the standard
    deviation is 1.0348139
  - The proportion of cases for which x + y \> 1 is 0.232

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](p8105_hw1_rac2224_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
