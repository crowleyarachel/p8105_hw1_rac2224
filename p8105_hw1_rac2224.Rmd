knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Problem 1

##creating dataframe

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

hw1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  norm_samp_log = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("one","two","three","four","five","six", "seven","eight"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("cat", "dog", "bird", "cat","dog","bird", "cat", "dog"))
)
```
##Taking the mean of each variable

```{r}
mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp))
```

##A mean was calculated for norm_samp 

```{r}
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
```
##The following error message was recieved when the mean of character vector, vec_char, was requested: "argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA[1] NA". This occured because it is composed of character variables and you cannot derive a mean.

```{r}
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
```

##The following error message was recieved when the mean of factor vector, vec_factor, was requested: "argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA[1] NA". This occured because it is composed of factor variables and you cannot derive a mean.

```{r}
mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp_log))
```

##A mean was calculated for the logical vector

```{r}
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
```
## Following message was recieved: NAs introduced by coercion[1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

```{r}
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
```

##output: [1] 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

```{r}
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp_log))
```

##output: [1] 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1

```{r}
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,norm_samp))
```
##vec_factor, norm_samp_log, and norm_samp could all be converted to a numeric variable. vec_char, the character vector, could not be converted to numeric, which explains why a mean was not calculated. 
       
##converting the logical vector

```{r}
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,norm_samp_log)) * (pull(hw1_df,norm_samp))
as.factor(pull(hw1_df,norm_samp_log)) * (pull(hw1_df,norm_samp))
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(hw1_df,norm_samp_log)))*(pull(hw1_df,norm_samp))
```

##Problem 2

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

plot_df2 = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  vec_log2 = x + y >1,
  vec_numeric2 = as.numeric(vec_log2), 
  vec_factor2 = as.factor(vec_log2)
)
```


* The size of the dataset is `r nrow(plot_df2)` rows and `r ncol(plot_df2)` columns
* The mean is `r mean(pull(plot_df2, x))`, the median is `r median(pull(plot_df2,x))`, and the standard deviation is `r sd(pull(plot_df2, x))`
* The proportion of cases for which x + y > 1 is `r mean(pull(plot_df2, vec_log2))`


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
